Once upon a time, there lived a poor couple in a small village situated at the outskirts of a city. They had two children, a boy and a girl. They worked very hard to make both ends meet. With great difficulty, they managed to bring up their children.    
One day they took their children to the city so that the children could enjoy themselves. They reached a park with a lot of greenery and some big trees. Soon after entering the park, the children started playing merrily. After playing for a couple of hours, the children were tired. Then all of them started to go underneath a big tree to have their lunch. At that time, the couple realised that the bag that they were carrying was missing. All the food items and a little money were kept in the bag. The children were very hungry as they played for a long time and they felt exhausted. But unfortunately, the parents couldn't do anything. The children started crying for food.
A good samaritan passing by, noticed the children crying and enquired with the parents about what went wrong. The father explained to the stranger what all happened. The stranger was moved by this and decided to help them. He purchased some food items from a nearby food court and fed the food to all the family members. Later on, he gave them some money to enable them to reach their home safely. The parents felt very happy and expressed their enormous gratitude to the stranger.
